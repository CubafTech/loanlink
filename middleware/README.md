we have to implement the following middlewares

Authentication Middleware: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

Authorization Middleware: Beyond authentication, we need to ensure that users can only manipulate their own data , only the admin can do update any information.

LEVELS OF ADMIN __:  Level 1 | Level 2
we should specify admins, | superAdmins,
with various permissions 


Input Validation Middleware: we'll Use middleware to validate and sanitize input data to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Libraries like express-validator can help with this.

Rate Limiting Middleware: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or brute force attacks on your API. You can use middleware like express-rate-limit to restrict the number of requests from an IP address.

CORS Middleware: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware to restrict which domains can access your API. This helps prevent unauthorized domains from making requests to your server.

Helmet Middleware: Use the Helmet middleware to add security-related HTTP headers to your responses, enhancing the security of your application.

Content Security Policy (CSP) Middleware: Implement CSP headers to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which sources of content are allowed to be loaded by a web page.

NoSQL Injection Protection: If you're using MongoDB, consider using a middleware like express-mongo-sanitize to protect against NoSQL injection attacks.

HTTPS Middleware: Enforce secure communication by setting up HTTPS for your Express application. You can use the https module or a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache with SSL/TLS certificates.

Error Handling Middleware: Implement robust error handling middleware to prevent sensitive error details from being exposed to clients and log errors securely.

Security Headers Middleware: Configure security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection to enhance security.

Session Management Middleware: If your platform uses sessions, ensure proper session management and security measures, including secure cookies and session timeouts.

Content Security Middleware: If your application serves user-generated content, validate and sanitize that content to prevent malicious uploads or scripts.
